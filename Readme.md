# Streamlit App for Apples Detection

In this repo, you will find an end-to-end computer vision app created using Streamlit. I have created a simple streamlit application by extendeding the code created for my previous [blogpost](https://shrishailsgajbhar.github.io/post/OpenCV-Apple-detection-counting).
